    <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
    <p>
        ▪Developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape  under name MOCHA<br>
▪Later renamed into Livescript and released on september1995<br>
▪Renamed to javascript and released on december 4,1995<br>
▪It was deployed in the netscape browser version 2<br>
▪Microsoft introduced a clone of javascript called jscript in internet explorer 3.0<br>
▪JS is now the standard client side scripting language and supported by all web<br> 
browsers available today<br>
▪JS is officially maintained by ECMA(European Computer Manufacturers <br>
Association)  as ECMAScript<br>
▪ES2015-ECMAScript2015 (old name-ES6)is the latest version<br>
    </p>
    <h2>VARIABLES</h2>
    <p>
        ▪Declare variables using var keyword<br>
▪Syntax:<br>
▪var varname=value;<br>
▪var x=8;<br>
▪var y=x+2;<br>
▪var name=“alan”;<br>
▪var isMarried=false;<br>
▪Javascript is also known as untyped language.<br> 
▪This means, that once a variable is created in javascript using the keyword <br>
var, we can store any type of value in this variable supported by javascript<br>
▪ES6 introduces 2 new keywords let and const<br>
▪const is a variable type assigned to data whose value cannot and will not 
change throughout the script.<br>
▪let name=“harry”;<br>
▪const PI=3.14;<br>
▪const and let have block-level scope<br>
▪var declare function scoped variables<br>
